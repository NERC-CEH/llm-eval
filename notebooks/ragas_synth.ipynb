A UK spatial framework of land parcels (vector-polygons) representing real-world objects (for example: fields, lakes, urban areas and so forth) was intersected with the 20m Classified Pixels to generate per-parcel pixel statistics. These include a histogram recording pixel frequency per land cover class, the modal land cover class, the total number of pixels and three attribute indicators of classification confidence. Land parcel classification results were validated against independently collected ground observations. All calculations were performed within a PosGIS database.
