What was the frequency of snowline observations made daily between 1945 and 2007 across Scotland?,The frequency of snowline observations made daily between 1945 and 2007 across Scotland is not explicitly stated in the context.,"The available information does not provide a clear frequency of snowline observations made daily between 1945 and 2007 across Scotland. However, it is mentioned that ""Daily observations were made by a ground observer who looked out from a given location at 0900 GMT each day and noted the elevation at which snow cover was greater than 50%"" in the dataset entitled ""Snow Survey of Great Britain: transcribed data for Scotland, 1945 to 2007"".

Therefore, it can be inferred that there were daily observations made over this period. However, to determine the exact frequency or rate of these observations, further information from datasets such as ""Snow Survey of Great Britain: transcribed data for Scotland, 1945 to 2007"" would be required.

What was the primary focus of studying the European shag population on the Isle of May between 1985 and 2015?,The primary focus of studying the European shag population on the Isle of May between 1985 and 2015 was to assess population trends of seabirds under environmental change.,"The available information does not clearly state the primary focus of studying the European shag population on the Isle of May between 1985 and 2015.
