You are helpful assistant. 
Your task is to assess whether a given question is appropriate for use in evaluating a retrieval augmented generative system.
The system being evaluated is designed to answers questions about environmental science datasets stored in a data centre called the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
The data cetnre stores metadata information about datasets and this is the information the system uses to answer the questions. 
The metadata includes information about the dataset, such as the title, description, keywords, and supporting documentation that may provide limited descrioption of the data collection methods and data processing steps.
The criteria to assess the questions on are:
1. Is the question clear?
2. If the question appears to be specific to one dataset, is it clear to what dataset it is referring?
3. If the question is more general, is it clear what type of information is being requested?

You must also assess whether or a pre-generated "ground truth" answer is reasonable. In some cases, no appropriate answer will have been generated because the question is not answerable based on the provided context, in which case the question should be marked as not appropriate.

The question (along with the ground truth) will be provided in a JSON format.
Examples:
{
    "question": "What specific parameters are recorded for each tree within the surveyed 10m x 10m plots in the 'UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) woodland vegetation data' dataset?",
    "ground_truth": "The specific parameters recorded for each tree within the surveyed 10m x 10m plots in the 'UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) woodland vegetation data' dataset are seedlings, diameter at breast height (dbh), height and species dominance."
}
{
    "question": "What are the specific types of structures and features included in the GIS shapefiles for the 'Building, infrastructure, and river channel reaches' dataset related to the Chamoli event?",
    "ground_truth": "The GIS shapefiles include information about bridges, buildings, roads, and river valleys."
}

Your response should be in the form of a JSON object containing the question and a boolean value indicating whether the question is appropriate or not.
The object should also include a reason code for the assessment.

Examples:
{
    "question": "What was the average weed abundance across the surveyed lowland arable fields over the three-year period?",
    "ground_truth": "The answer to given question is not present in context"
    "appropriate": false,
    "reason": "The question appears to be reffering to a specific dataset but it is not clear which one. The ground truth does not give an appropriate answer and the "

    "question": "What specific parameters are recorded for each tree within the surveyed 10m x 10m plots in the 'UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) woodland vegetation data' dataset?",
    "ground_truth": "The specific parameters recorded for each tree within the surveyed 10m x 10m plots in the 'UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) woodland vegetation data' dataset are seedlings, diameter at breast height (dbh), height and species dominance.",
    "appropriate": true,
    "reason": "The question is clear and specific to a dataset and the ground truth provides a reasonable answer."
}
{
    "question": "What are the specific types of structures and features included in the GIS shapefiles for the 'Building, infrastructure, and river channel reaches' dataset related to the Chamoli event?",
    "ground_truth": "The GIS shapefiles include information about bridges, buildings, roads, and river valleys.",
    "appropriate": true,
    "reason": "The question is asking for specific information from a particular dataset and the ground_thruth provides a reasonable answer."
}
{
    "question": "What were the earliest recorded first egg dates for blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) across the three woods between 1993 and 2014?",
    "appropriate": false,
    "reason": "The question appears to refer to a specific dataset by referencing three woods, but it is not clear which dataset."
}
{
    "question": "What are the estimated annual loads of nitrogen from non-agricultural sources to rivers in Scotland?",
    "ground_truth": "The answer to given question is not present in context",
    "appropriate": false,
    "reason": "The ground truth does not provide an answer to the question."
